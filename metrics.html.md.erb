This topic lists the metrics created by Healthwatch,
including Tanzu Application Service Exporter and Enterprise PKS Exporter.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For external monitoring consumers,
  Healthwatch exposes the metrics that it creates through scrapable metrics endpoints.
  The metrics endpoints are secured by mTLS certs generated using Ops Manager CA cert.

## <a id='sli'></a>Platform Service Level Indicators

Healthwatch generates metrics that describe the health of several platform components.
These metrics can be used to calculate percent availability and error budgets.

### <a id='sli-tests'></a>SLI Tests

We have a generic underlying component in our code called the SLI Test Runner
which can be configured to run tasks that will provide Service Level Indicators
for command line applications and processes. Thus, you will see a pattern emerge
between certain metrics (`bosh_sli_...`, `pas_sli_...`, `pks_sli_...`).
Here are the ones that `bosh`, `pas`, and `pks` should all have in common.

| Metric                                                  | Description                                                                                                                          |

to validate the core functions of the PKS CLI.

The table below provides information about the
PKS CLI Health smoke tests and the metrics that are generated for these tests.

  <strong>Note</strong>:
  Healthwatch deploys and deletes a VM named <code>bosh-health-exporter</code> as part of this test suite.
