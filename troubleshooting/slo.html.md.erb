Healthwatch ships with the following dashboards
included under the **Healthwatch** folder in Grafana.
To access them, go to **Dashboard -> Manage -> Healthwatch** in Grafana.

This dashboard will display a row
for each instance selected from the corresponding instance drop down
at the top of the page.
Each row has four panels:

  * The **Up** panel shows the current health of the [up](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/) metric,
    where a `1` indicates it is healthy
    and a `0` or missing data indicates that it is not healthy.
  * The **Exporter SLO** panel shows the percent of time the exporter was up over the selected time range.
  * The **Error Budget Remaining** panel shows how much time, in minutes, are left,
    in order to stay within the selected Uptime SLO Target
    over the currently selected time range.
  * The **Minutes of Downtime** panel shows how much downtime, in minutes,
    the exporters have experienced during the selected time range.
