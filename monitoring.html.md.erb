owner: PCF Healthwatch

This topic explains how to monitor the health of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch using the metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) generated by the service.

For general information about monitoring PCF, see [Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/index.html).

## <a id="aboutMetrics"></a>About Metrics

PCF Healthwatch emits metrics in the following format:

<pre>
origin:"healthwatch" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1509638101820496694 deployment:"healthwatch-app-dev-v1-1" job:"healthwatch-forwarder" index:"097f4b1e-5ca8-4866-82d5-00883798dad4" ip:"10.0.16.29" valueMetric:&lt;name:"healthwatch.metrics.published" value:38 unit:"count"&gt;
</pre>

All PCF Healthwatch-emitted metrics have the `healthwatch` origin.

## <a id="keyPerformanceIndicators"></a>Key Performance Indicators for PCF Healthwatch

This section describes the KPIs that you can use to monitor the health and performance of PCF Healthwatch.

###<a id="firehose-disconnect"></a>Number of Healthwatch Nozzle Disconnects from Firehose
<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br/> healthwatch.ingestor.disconnects<br/><br/></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>
        Number of forced disconnects of the <a href="./architecture.html">PCF Healthwatch data ingestor nozzle</a> from the Firehose.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: An unusual increase in the number of disconnects from the Firehose typically indicates that the nozzle needs to be scaled up. The Firehose disconnects nozzles that are slow consumers to protect apps from backpressure. This metric can also spike during a PCF deployment because the Traffic Controller VMs restart, logging a disconnect.
        <br/><br/>
        A prolonged period of losing metrics as a result of disconnects can endanger the assessments that PCF Healthwatch makes using Firehose-based platform metrics.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: Firehose<br/>
        <strong>Type</strong>: Gauge<br/>
        <strong>Frequency</strong>: 60 s<br/>
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended measurement</th>
      <td>Average over last 5 minutes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended alert thresholds</th>
      <td><strong>Yellow warning</strong>: Dynamic<br/>
      <strong>Red critical</strong>: Dynamic</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <th>Recommended response</th>
      <td>
         If no known deployment occurred and the spike is sustained, increase the number of Healthwatch Ingestor instances and monitor this metric to ensure it returns to a normal state.
         <br/><br/>
         Ingestor instances can be scaled in the Healthwatch Component Config tab of the PCF Healthwatch tile or using the <code>cf scale healthwatch-ingestor</code> command. While <code>cf scale</code> helps you to quickly scale the instances, you should also update the tile configuration so that the next deployment does not override the manual scaling.

###<a id="loader-dropped"></a>Number of Metrics Dropped by Healthwatch Data Loader
<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br/> healthwatch.loader.dropped<br/><br/></th></tr>

      <td>
        Number of metrics dropped by the <a href="./architecture.html">PCF Healthwatch data loader</a>, which loads incoming data into the Healthwatch datastore.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: An unusual increase in the number of dropped metrics by the Healthwatch Loader likely indicates that this component needs to be scaled up. A prolonged period of dropping metrics could endanger the assessments PCF Healthwatch makes from Firehose-based platform metrics.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Origin</strong>: Firehose<br/>
        <strong>Type</strong>: Gauge<br/>

   <tr>
      <th>Recommended response</th>
      <td>
         Increase the number of Healthwatch Loader instances and monitor this metric to ensure it returns to a normal state.
         <br/><br/>
         Loader instances can be scaled within the Healthwatch Component Config tab of the PCF Healthwatch tile or using the <code>cf scale healthwatch-loader</code> command. While <code>cf scale</code> helps you to quickly scale the instances, you should also update the tile configuration so that the next deployment does not override the manual scaling.

      <td>
        The PCF Healthwatch UI is currently available. This assessment is made using a probe that looks for a successful response: 1 = available, 0 = not available, or timeout (10 s).
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates that the Healthwatch UI is running and available to product end users. While an issue with the UI does not impact the assessments Healthwatch is making, loss of the UI can impact user ability to visually reference these assessments.

###<a id="cli-test-availability"></a>CLI Health Test Availability
<table>

        PCF Healthwatch has up-to-date results for the <a href="metrics.html#cli">CLI Command Health Test</a>, which means that the test was recently available.
        <br/><br/>
        Response: 1 = available, 0 = not available, or timeout (10 s)
        <br/><br/>
        An assessment of up-to-date results is made by looking for results within the configured run schedule plus timeout. For example, a test runner scheduled on 5-minute intervals with a 2-minute timeout must show a test result within the last 7 minutes to succeed.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Use</strong>: Indicates that PCF Healthwatch is assessing the current state of health for the CLI commands. If these continuous validation tests fail to make up-to-date assessments, they are no longer a reliable warning mechanism.
