title: Configuring Canary App Health Endpoint
owner: Pivotal Healthwatch
---

This topic describes how to use the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch API to do the following:

- View the current canary app health URL for the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) deployment.
- Update the canary app health URL for the PAS deployment.

See the [Canary App Health](../metrics.html#canaryapp) section for more information about this metric. 

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisite

The steps in this document require that you generate bearer tokens for a UAA client with the `healthwatch.read` and `healthwatch.admin` scopes. For more information on granting these scopes, see [Allow Additional Users to Access the Pivotal Healthwatch UI](../installing.html#healthwatch-uaa-users). For an example of generating and using a UAAC token for API calls, see [Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html).

## <a id='check-status'></a>Check Healthwatch API Status

To check the availability of the Healthwatch API, run the following command:

```
$ curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
```

A successful response is a `200`/`OK` with the message `"HAPI is happy"`.

## <a id='get'></a>View Canary URL

`GET /v1/canary?deployment=cf-GUID`

To view the currently configured canary URL, run the following command:

```
$ uaac curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/canary?deployment=cf-GUID
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The cf deployment is currently the only supported deployment for the canary url configuration. These endpoints only support deployment names beginning with <code>cf</code>. For more information about the cf deployment metric change, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#metrics-prefix">Changed “deployment” Field Value for PAS Metrics</a> in the PAS v2.4 release notes. <code>cf-GUID</code> is shown on the <code>healthwatch.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/diego/capacity</code> page.</p>

This returns a JSON object in the following format:

```
  {
    "deployment":"cf-GUID",
    "url":"CONFIGURED CANARY URL"
  }
```

## <a id='post'></a>Update Canary URL

`POST /v1/canary?deployment=cf-GUID`

To update the canary URL for a deployment, run the following command. Ensure that your URL includes a protocol, such as `https`. 

```
$ uaac curl -X POST "https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/canary?deployment=cf-GUID" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data "{\"url\":\"https://SOME-VALID-URL.com\"}"
```
