title: Configuring Free Chunk Sizes
owner: Pivotal Healthwatch
---

This topic describes how to use the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch API to retrieve and configure [Available Free Chunks of Memory](../metrics.html#free-memory-chunks) and [Available Free Chunks of Disk](../metrics.html#free-disk-chunks).

Currently, two main types of free chunk configurations are supported: Global and Deployment-specific. Through this API, consumers can do the following:

- View current free chunk configurations
- Update the Global free chunk size for memory and disk
- Create deployment-specific free chunk configurations
  - Applicable for customers isolating Compute (Diego Cells) into Isolation Segments, where different threshold values of concern may be needed

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites and Assumptions

The steps in this document assume you can generate bearer tokens for a UAA client with the `healthwatch.read` (`GET` only) and `healthwatch.admin` (both `GET` and `POST`) scopes. For detailed instructions on how to add these scopes, refer to the [Allow Additional Users to Access the Pivotal Healthwatch UI](../installing.html#healthwatch-uaa-users) documentation.

## <a id='info'></a>Healthwatch API Status

Test the availability of the Healthwatch API by hitting the `/info` endpoint with a simple `GET` request:

```
curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/info
```

The expected response is a `200`/`OK` with the message `"HAPI is happy"`.

## <a id='get'></a>View all free chunk configurations
### `GET /v1/free-chunks`

To view a list of free chunk configurations, send a `GET` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint:

```
uaac curl https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks
```

This returns a JSON array of free chunk configurations:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "deployment": "healthwatch-default",
    "value": 4096,
    "type": "memory"
  }
]
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: the value returned in the Pivotal Healthwatch API is in megabytes, but the Pivotal Healthwatch UI displays the value in gigabytes.</p>

## <a id='post'></a>Creating and updating free chunk configurations

### `POST /v1/free-chunks`

To create or update a free chunk configuration, make a `POST` request to the `/v1/free-chunks` endpoint with the following structure:

```
uaac curl -X POST "https://healthwatch-api.SYSTEM-DOMAIN/v1/free-chunks" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data "{\"value\":8192, \"deployment\":\"prod-isolation-segment\",\"type\":\"memory\"}"
```

Where:

- The `value` property is required.

- The `type` property is required. You must set it to either `memory` or `disk`.

- The `deployment` property is optional. If you exclude the property, the  global 
free chunk configuration is updated.

Possible successful HTTP response codes:

- 200: A record was updated
- 201: A new record was created
- 400: Invalid parameters

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The value supplied to the Pivotal Healthwatch API is in megabytes, but the Pivotal Healthwatch UI displays the value in gigabytes.</p>
