### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.

#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the app `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2 leave a namespace or folder and subfolders when the VM is deleted. The orphaned folders cause the vSAN object count to increase. This is a known issue for vSAN. For more information about the vSAN known issue, see [Deleted VMs leave components behind](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/issues/165) in GitHub.

To address the issue, update vSphere to v6.5 update 2 or later. Or, you can stop the `bosh-health-check` to slow down the increase in vSAN object count.

#### Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard Displays Error Due to Log Cache

Occasionally, the Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard charts will fail to load with the error: `"Error fetching graph data."`.

These charts are populated using Log Cache, which is part of Loggregator and will fail periodically due to Log Cache timing out while attempting to process the data.

No corrective action is required and it will self-resolve if possible.
