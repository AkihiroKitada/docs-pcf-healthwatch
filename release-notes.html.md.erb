##<a id='v1.3.1'></a>v1.3.1
**Release Date: July 23, 2018**

### Release Notes
* **[Bug Fix]** v1.3.0 contained a bad flyway migration. v1.3.1 corrects this issue, and is able to be upgraded to from prior versions of v1.2.x and v1.3.0.
    * **Please Note**: If previously on v1.3.0, whether via upgrade, or a new install, you must run the following steps when installing v1.3.1 or higher to preseve data. Alternatively, you may delete v1.3.0 and re-install at v1.3.1, but no data will be retained. 
1. Install the new v1.3.1 tile (this upgrade will then fail on the *Push Monitoring Components* errand).
1. [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh)
1. [Log into BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in)
1. Set healthwatch deployment name to variable:
	<pre class="terminal">
	export BOSH_DEPLOYMENT=$(bosh deployments --json | jq --raw-output '.Tables[].Rows[] | select(.name | contains("p-healthwatch")) | .name')
	</pre>
1. SSH to Healthwatch Forwarder VM:
	<pre class="terminal">
	bosh ssh healthwatch-forwarder/0
  </pre>
1. Become root and set the MySQL credentials into the environment

sudo -i
$(grep MYSQL_ /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch-forwarder/bin/healthwatch-forwarder.ctl)
	<pre class="terminal">
export re='^jdbc\:mysql\:\/\/([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\:([0-9]+)\/(\S+)$'
if [[ "$MYSQL_URL" =~ $re ]]; then
  echo "Exporting MYSQL_IP, MYSQL_PORT, and MYSQL_DATABASE environment variables."
  export MYSQL_IP=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}
  export MYSQL_PORT=${BASH_REMATCH[2]}
  export MYSQL_DATABASE=${BASH_REMATCH[3]}
fi
  </pre>
1. Tell flyway to roll up the older migrations and run the new ones. <em>Note: Please ignore the flyway WARNING messages, but not ERROR messages.</em>
	<pre class="terminal">
  /var/vcap/packages/mariadb/bin/mariadb --host=${MYSQL_IP} \
  --port=${MYSQL_PORT} --user=${MYSQL_USERNAME} --password=${MYSQL_PASSWORD} ${MYSQL_DATABASE} \
  -e "TRUNCATE TABLE $MYSQL_DATABASE.schema_version"

/var/vcap/packages/flyway/flyway -user=${MYSQL_USERNAME} -password=${MYSQL_PASSWORD} -url=${MYSQL_URL} \
  -locations='filesystem:/var/vcap/jobs/push-apps/packages/healthwatch-data/dbmigrations' \
  -baselineVersion=1201 \
  baseline

/var/vcap/packages/flyway/flyway -user=${MYSQL_USERNAME} -password=${MYSQL_PASSWORD} -url=${MYSQL_URL} \
  -locations='filesystem:/var/vcap/jobs/push-apps/packages/healthwatch-data/dbmigrations' \
  migrate
    </pre>
1. Tile should be succesfully installed

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.3.1:

* Currently if Windows-based Diego Cell instances are created via Pivotal Application Service for Windows, these cells are emitting their platform metrics with a hard-coded deployment value of `cf`. This can result in the following impacts to capacity values shown by PCF Healthwatch, or other consumers of monitoring metrics:
    * If [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/adminguide/isolation-segments.html) are used in combination with Isolated Windows-based Diego Cells: Any windows-based cells that are isolated to a given isolation segment are reporting as part of the core cf system deployment. This means that the isolation segment(s) capacity values will be underreporting (i.e., only including linux-based cells and excluding windows-based cells), and the core cf system deployment will be over-reporting capacity (including windows-based cells from isolation segments as part of the core cf system capacity).
    * If Isolation Segments are not used: The core CF system deployment will correctly show total capacity, however both windows-based Cells and linux-based Cells will be grouped together in PCF Healthwatch capacity assessments such as capacity remaining and number of free chunks of memory.
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
    * Query Rate
    * MySQL CPU Busy Time
    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='v1.3.0'></a>v1.3.0
**Release Date: July 17, 2018**

### Release Notes
* If leveraging the alerting capability, PCF Healthwatch v1.3 requires [PCF Event Alerts v1.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/event-alerts)
* **[Feature]** Updated to support monitoring of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2. 
* **[Feature]** The PCF Healthwatch dashboard UI now highlights Routing and Capacity for Isolation Segment usage.
* The default threshold values for `VM Memory Used` Alert have been modified: 95% critical and 85% warning.
   * If these thresholds have been previously modified, this update will not override that user configuration. 

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.3.0:

* **[Bug Identified]** v1.3.0 contains a bad flyway migration. This causes issues in upgrades from PCF Healthwatch v1.2.3 or later, and will cause issues in future versions of v1.3. v1.3.0 is no longer available. 
* Currently if Windows-based Diego Cell instances are created via Pivotal Application Service for Windows, these cells are emitting their platform metrics with a hard-coded deployment value of `cf`. This can result in the following impacts to capacity values shown by PCF Healthwatch, or other consumers of monitoring metrics:
    * If [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/adminguide/isolation-segments.html) are used in combination with Isolated Windows-based Diego Cells: Any windows-based cells that are isolated to a given isolation segment are reporting as part of the core cf system deployment.

##<a id='whatsnew'></a>What's New in PCF Healthwatch v1.3

The section below summarizes key differences between PCF Healthwatch v1.2 and v1.3. For more information about new features in v1.3, see [v1.3.0 release notes](release-notes.html#v1.3.0).

### Key Differences
* **Canary Test Feature Enhancement:** Customers can now [configure](api/canary-configuration.html) what cf app the Canary Health test pings
    * The default application will continue to be Apps Manager unless modified to a desired configuration. If updated, the modified URL will be available to view in the UI (Canary Health info interaction). The modification will persist through upgrades. The functionality of the test, what it measures, and the related [metrics emitted](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-healthwatch/1-3/metrics.html#canaryapp) as a result of the test will stay the same. 
* **Syslog Drain Available for the productâ€™s VM BOSH logs**
    * [Forwarding](installing.html#configure-syslog-forwarding) these system logs to a remote destination allows for: viewing logs from every VM in the PCF Healthwatch deployment in one place; troubleshooting errors when logs are lost on the source VM. 
    * Does not currently support TLS. 
* **[Feature]** New data loss alerts are available. It is highly recommended to [subscribe](http://docs.pivotal.io/event-alerts/1-2/installing.html) to these alerts as the loss of a platform data feed will impair the ability of Healthwatch to effectively monitor the foundation.
   * `Healthwatch is not receiving needed monitoring metrics from PCF` results from a loss of firehose data for an extended period of time
   * `Healthwatch is not receiving needed health metrics from BOSH` results from a loss of bosh health monitor data in the firehose for an extended period of time
* **UI Updates:**
    * To enable easier navigation across component details pages, an expanding left navigation is now available in the UI. 
    * Based on feedback, the detailed results table information on Canary App Health, CLI Command Health, BOSH Director Health, and Ops Man Health now includes the Application GUID of the tester app, rather than the Runner ID. The App GUID is more useful for troubleshooting any potential issues with the test application itself. 
    * The `Job Vitals` panel previously present on the main dashboard has been removed. The primary value of this panel, identifying threshold outliers, is now addressed by available alerting functionality. The `Job Health` panel is still available.
* **Additional capacity metrics available in datastore**
    * In the course of troubleshooting memory or disk errors, `rep.CapacityAllocatedMemory`, `rep.ContainerUsageMemory`, `rep.CapacityAllocatedDisk`, and `rep.ContainerUsageDisk` , can be [useful informational metrics](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/keep-your-app-platform-in-a-happy-state-an-operators-guide-to-capacity-management-on-pivotal-cloud-foundry) about the individual Diego Cells. These metrics are now available [to access](using.html#mysql) in the PCF Healthwatch datastore.
* Metrics created by PCF Healthwatch and published back into the firehose were previously emitted with the job name `metron_forwarder`. As of v1.3.x, the job name is now ``healthwatch_forwarder` to better align with the actual name of the VM.
