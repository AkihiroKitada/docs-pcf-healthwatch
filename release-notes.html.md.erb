##<a id='v1.3.0'></a>v1.3.0
**Release Date: June x, 2018**

### Release Notes
* **[Feature]** Updated to support monitoring of Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.2. 
* **[Feature]** The PCF Healthwatch dashboard UI now highlights Routing and Capacity for Isolation Segment Usage. 
* If leveraging the alerting capability, PCF Healthwatch v1.3 requires [PCF Event Alerts v1.2](https://docs.pivotal.io/event-alerts)
* Based on feedback, `system.mem.percent` default alerting thresholds have been updated to 95% for critical and 85% for warning. Please note: if thresholds have been customised, this release will not override configured settings. 
* Syslog Drain KSI threshold defaults have been revised to new thresholds: 250 drain bindings for critical and 200 for warning. Please note: if thresholds have been customised, this release will not override configured settings. 
* We have updated `metron_forwarder` to be referenced as `healthwatch_forwarder` to better align with the name of the VM in order to provide more clarity about where metrics are emitting from. All metrics that were previously labeled as emitting from `metron_forwarder` will be tagged as emitting from `healthwatch_forwarder` as of this verion of PCF Healthwatch. 
* **[Bug Fix]** The [known metrics emission issue](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#uaa-request-latency) preventing `UAA Request Latency` from being emitted in PCF has been resolved. 
* **[Feature]** Give that the `UAA Request Latency` metrics is now emitted in PCF, Healthwatch has provided an out of the box alert for monitoring [UAA Request Latency](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/monitoring/kpi.html#uaa_latency).

### Known Issues

PCF Healthwatch v1.3.0:

* Currently if Windows-based Diego Cell instances are created via Pivotal Application Service for Windows, these cells are emitting their platform metrics with a hard-coded deployment value of `cf`. This can result in the following impacts to capacity values shown by PCF Healthwatch, or other consumers of monitoring metrics:
    * If [Isolation Segments](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/adminguide/isolation-segments.html) are used in combination with Isolated Windows-based Diego Cells: Any windows-based cells that are isolated to a given isolation segment are reporting as part of the core cf system deployment. This means that the isolation segment(s) capacity values will be underreporting (i.e., only including linux-based cells and excluding windows-based cells), and the core cf system deployment will be over-reporting capacity (including windows-based cells from isolation segments as part of the core cf system capacity).
    * If Isolation Segments are not used: The core CF system deployment will correctly show total capacity, however both windows-based Cells and linux-based Cells will be grouped together in PCF Healthwatch capacity assessments such as capacity remaining and number of free chunks of memory.
* Hides three of the [PAS MySQL KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html#kpi4MySQL) charts. These charts will be available in a future patch version:
    * Query Rate
    * MySQL CPU Busy Time
    * Percentage of Max Connections Used

##<a id='whatsnew'></a>What's New in PCF Healthwatch v1.3

The section below summarizes key differences between PCF Healthwatch v1.2 and v1.3. For more information about new features in v1.3, see [v1.3.0 release notes](release-notes.html#v1.3.0).

### Key Differences
* **Canary Test Feature Enhancement:** Customers can now configure what cf app the Canary Health test pings
    * The default application will continue to be Apps Man unless modified to a desired configuration. If updated, the modified URL will be available to view in the UI (Canary Health info interaction). The modification will persist through upgrades. The functionality of the test, what it measures, and the related metrics emitted as a result of the test will stay the same. 
* **Syslog Drain Available for the productâ€™s VM BOSH logs**
    * Forwarding these system logs to a remote destination allows for: viewing logs from every VM in the PCF Healthwatch deployment in one place; troubleshooting errors when logs are lost on the source VM. 
    * Does not currently support TLS. 
* **UI Updates:**
    * To enable easier navigation across component details pages, an expanding left navigation is now available in the UI. 
    * Based on feedback, we have updated the detailed results table information on Canary App Health, CLI Command Health, BOSH Director Health, and Ops Man Health to now include the Application GUID of the tester app, rather than the Runner ID. The App GUID is more useful for troubleshooting any potential issues with the test application itself.
