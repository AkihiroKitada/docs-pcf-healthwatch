## <a id='v1.8.0'></a>v1.8.0

**Release Date: December 17, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Ingress metrics from Reverse Log Proxy (Firehose v2), rather than Traffic Controllers (Firehose v1). RLP has a more configurable API and a longer support window. See [Loggregator RLP Documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release#reverse-log-proxy-rlp) for more details.
* Add Syslog and Forwarder Agents to Pivotal Healthwatch VMs, which emit syslog directly from the VM rather than through the Firehose
* Remove `Adapter Loss Rate` and `CF Syslog Drain Binding Count` from Healthwatch
* `log_cache.cache_period` renamed to `log_cache.log_cache_cache_period` to Open Metrics naming conventions

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues.

#### BOSH Health Check Fails After Reinstallation

If Healthwatch is uninstalled and re-installed while the BOSH Health Check is running, then the BOSH Health Check fails to deploy, and reports an error in the Healthwatch UI.

To address this issue, manually delete the `bosh-health-check` deployment and restart the `bosh-health-check` app.

This will be fixed in v1.7.2+ and v1.8.1+.

#### Disk Slowly Fills When Using vSAN with Healthwatch Leads

The vSAN object count increases on vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2.

Healthwatch deploys the app `bosh-health-check`, which deploys and deletes a VM every 10 minutes. vSphere versions earlier than v6.5 update 2 leave a namespace or folder and subfolders when the VM is deleted. The orphaned folders cause the vSAN object count to increase. This is a known issue for vSAN. For more information about the vSAN known issue, see [Deleted VMs leave components behind](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/issues/165) in GitHub.

To address the issue, update vSphere to v6.5 update 2 or later. Or, you can stop the `bosh-health-check` to slow down the increase in vSAN object count.

#### Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard Displays Error Due to Log Cache

Occasionally, the Indicator Protocol Beta Dashboard charts will fail to load with the error: `"Error fetching graph data."`.

These charts are populated using Log Cache, which is part of Loggregator and will fail periodically due to Log Cache timing out while attempting to process the data.

No corrective action is required and it will self-resolve if possible.
