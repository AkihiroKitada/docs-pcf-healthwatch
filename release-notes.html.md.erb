##<a id='v1.0.7'></a>v1.0.7 (Beta)
**Release Date: October 10, 2017**

### Release Notes
* Updates made to PCF Healthwatch to support PCF v1.12:
    * Logging Throughput, Dropped Messages, and Firehose Loss Rate have been updated to reflect correct metric math for PCF v1.12. The charts still work appropriately on PCF v1.11. 
    * `Router File Descriptors` and `Router Exhausted Connections` have been added as recommended Router metrics specific to PCF v1.12.
    * Router, Logging, and Diego Performance contextual help has been updated to show where calculations differ between PCF v1.11 and PCF v1.12.
* Improvements to the UI:
    * If BOSH metrics have not yet been connected, the Job Health stoplight now shows 0% Healthy as Red.
    * Based on updated Router recommendations to monitor `gorouter.ms_since_last_registry_update` per router instance, the `Time Since Last Route Register Received` graph is now a per-instance multi-line graph.
* The push apps errand now tries to run 3 times before failing.
* On a failed BOSH Health Checker, PCF Healthwatch now logs out the BOSH CLI output to ease debugging.
* Property `requires_product_versions`: `>= 1.11`
* Golang version: v1.8.4
* MySQL version: v36.6
* MySQL release ensures the superuser is `admin`. The root user does not have admin access.
* Bug Fixed: The `VM_credentials` property was previously being duplicated. This is now resolved.
* Bug Fixed: Corrected naming mismatch in the `run.sh` file. The corrected file is now associated with current and former releases on Pivotal Network

### Known issues
* **Note**: You must repeat the [Getting BOSH Health Metrics](installing.html#bosh-metrics) steps every time the BOSH Director is recreated. The BOSH Director is recreated when you upgrade Ops Manager and install, upgrade, and delete data service tiles (for example, MySQL, RabbitMQ, or Redis).
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.
* The [Metron Forwarder](architecture.html) is not currently in a highly available configuration.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch when run on PCF v1.11. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is resolved in PCF v1.12.

##<a id='v1.0.6'></a>v1.0.6 (Beta)
**Release Date: September 26, 2017**

### Release Notes
* The PCF Healthwatch tile now includes smoke tests, which are executed using an errand upon installation and upgrade. These smoke tests validate the following:
    * UI is running.
    * Platform metrics are being ingested.
    * BOSH VM metrics are being ingested. **Note**: Because ingestion of BOSH metrics in v1.0 requires additional configuration, this portion of the tests does not result in a hard failure if the metrics are not being ingested. Instead, a soft failure allows the smoke tests to pass, but it writes out a message directing the operator to documentation on how to configure these metrics.
* A buildpack dependency that could cause an installation issue in an air-gapped environment has been corrected.
* Improvements to the UI:
    * On the Job Health and Vitals screen, if jobs do not report a Persistent Disk measure, the summary graph displays `N/A` and the related line chart does not appear. If a given job reports Persistent Disk, both the summary graph and the related line chart reflect the reported value.
    * Contextual Help interaction and content was added to the CLI Command Health, BOSH Director Health, Ops Manager Health, and Canary App Health secondary screens.

### Known issues
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.
* The [Metron Forwarder](architecture.html) is not currently in a highly available configuration.

##<a id='v1.0.5'></a>v1.0.5 (Beta)
**Release Date: September 14, 2017**

### Release Notes
* The `healthwatch-bosh-plugin` plugin has been updated. If this is your first installation of PCF Healthwatch, follow the standard instructions in [Installing PCF Healthwatch](installing.html). If you have installed an earlier version of PCF Healthwatch, see [Upgrading PCF Healthwatch to v1.0.5](upgrading-from-alpha.html).
* PCF Healthwatch now reflects the occurrence of BOSH deployments in the visualizations of platform metrics and the continuous validation test results. The time periods reflected for a BOSH deployment are based on the [BOSH deployment occurrence](metrics.html#bosh-deployment) metric.
* Chart Info content additions:
    * As a user hovers over a given chart within a panel, a help `?` icon appears. Clicking on the help icon provides information about the metric(s) driving the chart.
* Contextual Help panel content additions:
    * As a user hovers over a panel, an information icon appears on that given panel. Clicking on this icon opens a new tabbed screen with content relevant to the metrics displayed on the panel.
* Improvements to the UI.
* Prior known issues fixed:
    * On the Job Health screen, the **Only Show Errors** toggle feature now works as expected.

### Known issues
* If an alpha version of PCF Healthwatch was installed, you must delete it before proceeding with the installation of this beta tile. The alpha tile was not upgradable.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.
* The [Metron Forwarder](architecture.html) is not currently in a highly available configuration.

##<a id='v1.0.4 ALPHA 7'></a>v1.0.4 ALPHA 7
**Release Date: September 7, 2017**

### Release Notes

* The `healthwatch.read` scope has been added to the UAA Admin user by default in ERT v1.11.9 and later. As a result of this change, the minimum compatible Elastic Runtime version has been raised to v1.11.9 or later.
* Updates for adjusted PCF v1.11 monitoring recommendations:
    * The `route_emitter.RouteEmitterSyncDuration` metric should be monitored per job instead of globally as in PCF v1.10 and prior. PCF Healthwatch is updated to render the chart as a multi-line graph to highlight any problematic job(s). 
    * The `locket.ActiveLocks` metric threshold should be &ne; 4 instead of > 4. The visual alert banding was updated to bring attention to any measurement less than or greater than 4.
* The Job Health and Vitals dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) metrics for monitoring the underlying VM health.
    * The Job Health screen now defaults to displaying jobs with errors. This filter feature can be toggled off to display the red and green health results of all jobs reporting in the deployment.
    * Each job group displayed on the Job Health screen now includes a link to a deeper health overview of that group. This overview includes the following:
        * A Metrics Summary, which is a scrollable and filterable data representation of all jobs in a group. For each job over the chosen time interval, the summary provides information about Count of Failed Health Checks, CPU, System Disk, Persistent Disk, and Ephemeral Disk.
        * A Health section with a representation of the health check at the individual job level. This display is driven by the filtered Metrics Summary. 
        * A Job Vitals section displaying the recommended Job Vitals metrics for each filtered job. This display is driven by the filtered Metrics Summary. 
* Contextual Help content has been added to all main dashboard panels and some deep dive screens.
    * When a user hovers over any main dashboard panel, an information icon appears on that given panel. Clicking on this icon opens a new tabbed screen with content relevant to the metrics displayed on the panel.
* Prior known issues fixed:
    * The bug identified in Alpha 6, a malformed URL in the BOSH Health Check test, has been resolved. 

### Known issues
* Bug identified: On the Job Health screen, the **Only Show Errors** toggle feature does not work as expected. This means that you cannot currently change the page to reflect all healthy and unhealthy jobs reporting. The bug will be fixed in the next release.
* If an earlier alpha version of PCF Healthwatch was installed, you must delete it before proceeding with the installation of the newer tile. The tile is not upgradable at this time.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.
* BOSH deployments are not yet reflected on any deep-dive screens.
* Contextual help content additions are still in progress throughout the product.

##<a id='v1.0.0-alpha.6'></a>v1.0.0-alpha.6
**Release Date: August 24, 2017**

### Release Notes

* The Ops Manager Health Check dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of test results for the [Ops Manager](metrics.html#opsman) continuous validation test.
* The App Canary Health Check dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of test results for the [App Canary](metrics.html#appsman) continuous validation test.
* The Diego Capacity dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) metrics for monitoring PCF capacity.
This dashboard is available through the Capacity panel on the main PCF Healthwatch dashboard.
* The Diego App Instances dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) metrics for monitoring PCF app instances. This dashboard is available through the App Instances panel on the main PCF Healthwatch dashboard.
* The Diego Performance dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) metrics for monitoring Diego health and performance. This dashboard is available through a tab selection from the Diego Capacity and Diego App Instances dashboards.
* The Job Health and Vitals dashboard has been started.
* The CLI Command Health Smoke Test feature is improved. When the `cf-health-check` app fails, a `-1` (did not run) value is recorded for the `cf push` test. This helps operators to determine when the test itself fails.
* Canary App Response Time values are now stored in milliseconds (ms) instead of nanoseconds (ns).
* Improvements to the UI:

    * The Scalable Syslog Performance panel on the Logging Performance deep-dive page is now dynamic and appears only if the Scalable Syslog feature is being used in the foundation.
        * If Drain Binding Count is &ge; 1 within the 24-hour retention period, the panel is displayed.
        * If Drain Binding Count is &equiv; 0 within the 24-hour retention period, the panel is not rendered.

### Known issues

* Bug identified: The BOSH Health Check test will continue to fail in this version due to a malformed URL. The bug will be fixed in the next release.
* If an earlier alpha version of PCF Healthwatch was installed, it must be deleted before proceeding with the installation of the newer tile. The tile is not upgradable at this time.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.

##<a id='v1.0.0-alpha.5'></a>v1.0.0-alpha.5
**Release Date: August 8, 2017**

### Release Notes

* PCF Healthwatch now forwards its product-generated [metrics](metrics.html) into the Firehose, allowing other existing Firehose consumers to access these operationally useful data points.
* The URL for the Dashboard UI was updated to `healthwatch.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
* The BOSH Director Health Check dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of test results for the [BOSH Director](metrics.html#bosh-director) continuous validation test.
* The Logging Performance dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/kpi.html#doppler-server) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#doppler-server) metrics for monitoring the Logging system.
* The Router Performance dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/kpi.html#gorouter) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#Router) metrics for monitoring the GoRouter.
* PCF Healthwatch now stores and displays VM ID instead of index to make VM info more usable for BOSH2 interactions.
* PCF Healthwatch now points healthcheck apps at MySQL Proxy instead of a MySQL node, which resolves the issue in earlier alphas where downtime would be experienced during a PCF Healthwatch stemcell update.

### Known issues

* If an earlier alpha version of PCF Healthwatch was installed, it must be deleted before proceeding with the installation of the newer tile. The tile is not upgradable at this time.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.

    * `healthwatch.scalablesyslog.rlp.lossRate.1M` will be updated to `healthwatch.ScalableSyslog.RLP.LossRate.1M`.
    * `healthwatch.scalablesyslog.adapter.LossRate.1M` will be updated to `healthwatch.ScalableSyslog.Adapter.LossRate.1M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableDiskCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableDiskCapacity.5M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableContainerCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableContainerCapacity.5M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableMemoryCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableMemoryCapacity.5M`.
* The following dashboards are not yet completed as of this Alpha 5 version:
    * Diego: Capacity 
    * Diego: App Instances
    * Diego: Diego Performance 
    * Ops Manager Health Check
