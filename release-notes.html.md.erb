**Release Date: August 8, 2017**

### Release Notes

* PCF Healthwatch now forwards its product-generated [metrics](metrics.html) into the Firehose, allowing other existing Firehose consumers to access these operationally useful data points.
* The URL for the Dashboard UI was updated to `healthwatch.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
* The BOSH Director Health Check dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of test results for the [BOSH Director](metrics.html#bosh-director) continuous validation test.
* The Logging Performance dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/kpi.html#doppler-server) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#doppler-server) metrics for monitoring the Logging system.
* The Router Performance dashboard is complete and now offers up to 24 hours of the recommended [KPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/kpi.html#gorouter) and [KSI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html#Router) metrics for monitoring the GoRouter.
* PCF Healthwatch now stores and displays VM ID instead of index to make VM info more usable for BOSH2 interactions.
* PCF Healthwatch now points healthcheck apps at MySQL Proxy instead of a MySQL node, which resolves the issue in earlier alphas where downtime would be experienced during a PCF Healthwatch stemcell update.

### Known issues

* If an earlier alpha version of PCF Healthwatch was installed, it must be deleted before proceeding with the installation of the newer tile. The tile is not upgradable at this time.
* Router latency measurement (the `gorouter.latency` metric) has a known issue present in PCF v1.11 that may impact PCF Healthwatch. This [router issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter/issues/173) is expected to be resolved in PCF v1.12.
* The Adapter Loss Rate and Reverse Log Proxy Loss Rate metrics will be incorrect (always 0) until an issue with how these metrics are currently emitted is resolved.
* The Scalable Syslog Performance panel on the Logging Performance deep-dive screen is intended to be dynamic, appearing only if the Scalable Syslog feature is being used in the foundation. This panel will be dynamic in the next version (Alpha 6).
* The `healthwatch-forwarder` resource is defaulted to 3 instances in the PCF Healthwatch tile configuration. This can be changed to 1 instance. The default will be corrected in the next version (Alpha 6).
* Currently, 5 metrics have slight variations from the data points published in [PCF Healthwatch Metrics](metrics.html). This will be corrected in the next version (Alpha 6):
    * `healthwatch.scalablesyslog.rlp.lossRate.1M` will be updated to `healthwatch.ScalableSyslog.RLP.LossRate.1M`.
    * `healthwatch.scalablesyslog.adapter.LossRate.1M` will be updated to `healthwatch.ScalableSyslog.Adapter.LossRate.1M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableDiskCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableDiskCapacity.5M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableContainerCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableContainerCapacity.5M`.
    * `healthwatch.TotalPercentageAvailableMemoryCapacity.5M` will be updated to `healthwatch.Diego.TotalPercentageAvailableMemoryCapacity.5M`.
* The following dashboards are not yet completed as of this Alpha 5 version:
    * Diego: Capacity 
    * Diego: App Instances
    * Diego: Diego Performance 
    * OpsMan Health Check
    * App Canary Health Check
    * Job Health and Job Vitals
* BOSH deployments are not yet reflected on any deep-dive screens.
* Contextual help content is not yet present.
