This topic contains release notes for Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Healthwatch v2.0.6 is a beta version that is no longer
  available for download. VMware does not recommend using Healthwatch v2.0.6 in production
  environments.</p>

Healthwatch v2.1 is very different from Pivotal Healthwatch v1. Healthwatch v2.1 uses the open-source
components Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager to scrape, store, and view metrics, as well
as configure alerts. For more information about the differences between Pivotal Healthwatch
v1 and Healthwatch v2 and how to upgrade, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).

Platform Monitoring](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/healthwatch-vmware-tanzu-2-1-platform-monitoring)

Using Healthwatch v2.1](index.html#assumed-risks) and [Healthwatch v2.1 Limitations](index.html#healthwatch-limitations)

## <a id='upgrade'></a> How to Upgrade

To upgrade from Pivotal Healthwatch v1 to Healthwatch v2.1, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).


## <a id='new-features'></a> New Features

Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1 include the following major features:

### <a id='supports-tkgi-1-10'></a> Healthwatch Supports TKGI v1.10

You can use Healthwatch to monitor TKGI v1.10.

Your TKGI dashboard in the Grafana UI updates automatically to display TKGI v1.10 metrics unless
you manually set the dashboard version when you configure the Grafana VM. For more information
about setting the TGKI version for your dashboards, see [Configure Grafana](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#grafana)
in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='assign-static-ips'></a> Assign Static IP Addresses to Prometheus VMs

You can assign static IP addresses to your Prometheus VMs.

If you configure email alerts through Alertmanager, you may need to add the IP addresses of
your Prometheus VMs to your Ops Manager allowlist so your SMTP server does not block them.
You can then view the IP addresses of your Prometheus VMs using the BOSH CLI.

For more information about assigning IP addresses to your Prometheus VMs, see [(Optional) Configure
Prometheus](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

### <a id='replaces-event-alerts'></a> Healthwatch Replaces Event Alerts With Alertmanager

Healthwatch v2.1 uses Alertmanager, an open-source Prometheus component, to manage and send
alerts according to the alerting rules you configure. Pivotal Healthwatch v1 used Pivotal Event
Alerts for managing alerts, which Healthwatch v2.1 does not support.

For more information about configuring alerts, see [Alerting](configuring/optional-config/alerting.html).

### <a id='removes-indicator-protocol'></a> Healthwatch Removes Monitoring Indicator Protocol

Healthwatch no longer supports Monitoring Indicator Protocol, and the **Indicator Protocol**
dashboard is removed from the Grafana UI.

This change does not affect RabbitMQ metrics and dashboards.


## <a id='breaking-changes'></a> Breaking Changes

Healthwatch v2.0.6 includes the following breaking changes:

### <a id='self-signed-certs'></a> Self-Signed Certificates Break Dashboards

While Pivotal Healthwatch v1 does not require SSL validation of Ops Manager certificates, Healthwatch
v2.1 checks for SSL validation by default. If your Ops Manager deployment uses self-signed
certificates, you must configure the Healthwatch tile to skip SSL validation.

If the **Ops Manager Health** dashboard in the Grafana UI displays a "Not Running" error, select
the **Skip SSL validation** checkbox in the **Canary URL Configuration** pane of the Healthwatch
tile. For more information about configuring this checkbox, see [(Optional) Configure Canary
URLs](configuring/configuring-healthwatch.html#canary) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

If your **Certificate Expiration** dashboard displays "N/A" or you see errors in your certificate
expiration metric logs, select the **Skip SSL Validation for Cert Expiration** in the **TAS
Exporter Configuration** pane of the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile or the **TKGI
Exporter Configuration** pane of the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile. For more information
about configuring this checkbox, see [(Optional) Configure TAS for VMs Metric Exporter VMs]
(configuring/configuring-exporter-tas.html#exporter-config) in _Configuring Healthwatch Exporter
for TAS for VMs_ or [(Optional) Configure TKGI and Certificate Expiration Metric Exporter VMs]
(configuring/configuring-exporter-tkgi.html#exporter-config) in _Configuring Healthwatch Exporter
for TKGI_.


## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known Issues

Healthwatch v2.0.6 and v2.1 include the following known issues:

### <a id="upgrade-from-om-23"></a> "Unable to Render Templates" Error When Installing or Upgrading

This issue is fixed in Ops Manager v2.8 and later.

When installing or upgrading to Healthwatch v2.1, you could see the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
- Unable to render templates for job 'opsman-cert-expiration-exporter'. Errors are:
  - Error filling in template 'bpm.yml.erb' (line 9: Can't find property '["opsman_access_credentials.uaa_client_secret"]')
</pre>

This error occurs if you upgraded from Ops Manager v2.3 or earlier to Ops Manager v2.4 through
v2.7. 

For more information about how to fix this issue without upgrading to Ops Manager v2.8, see [HEADER](troubleshooting.html#ANCHOR) in _Troubleshooting_.

### <a id="pks-cluster-discovery-nsxt-ports"></a> TKGI Cluster Discovery Requires Opening VMware NSX-T Load Balancer Ports

If you enable TKGI cluster discovery on a VMware NSX-T foundation, the VMware NSX-T load balancer
does not open the required ports by default. To enable your Prometheus instance to scrape on-demand
TKGI clusters, you must open the following ports: `10200`, `10251`, `10252`, and `8443`.

For more information about how to open the ports using the VMware NSX-T Manager API, see [HEADER](troubleshooting.html#ANCHOR) in _Troubleshooting_.

### <a id="kubernetes-node-panels-no-data"></a> No Data on TKGI Kubernetes Nodes Dashboard

If you are using TKGI v1.9 or earlier, the **Kubernetes Nodes** dashboard in the Grafana UI
might not show data for individual pods. This is due to a known issue in Kubernetes v1.19.2.

To fix this issue, upgrade to TKGI v1.10. For more information about upgrading to TKGI v1.10, see [Upgrading Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](../tkgi/1-10/upgrading.html).

### <a id='mysql-proxy-maxed'></a> MySQL Proxy Disk Space Fills Up Quickly

In Healthwatch v2.0.6, the MySQL PXC instance stores too many binlogs, which fills up the persistent
disk space for MySQL Proxy VMs at a faster rate.

To fix this issue, upgrade to Healthwatch v2.1. For more information about upgrading to Healthwatch v2.1, see [Upgrading Healthwatch](upgrading-healthwatch.html).
