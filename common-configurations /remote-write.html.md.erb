TSDB can be configured to write to remote storage,
in addition to its local time series database.
This is intended to support long-term storage of monitoring data.

Here's the [full configuration for remote writing](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

The form in the **Healthwatch** tile is
basically a user-friendly input
to this more complete configuration.

## Configure Remote Write

To configure remote write for the Healthwatch tile,
perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Remote Write Configuration** and do the following:
    1. Input the **URL** for your storage endpoint.
        Example: `https://REMOTE-STORAGE-URL`,
        where `REMOTE-STORAGE-URL` is a fully-qualified domain name.
    1. Optional: Set a **Remote Timeout**.
    1. Optional: Enable Basic Authentication
        to access your storage endpoint via username and password.
    1. Optional: Configure TLS for your endpoint.
        If the remote write endpoint requires special handling,
        for example a self-signed cert or mutual TLS,
        that can be configured here.
    1. Optional: Configure a **Proxy URL** to connect to the remote write endpoint.
    1. Optional: To fine-tune your remote write configuration,
        look at the `queue_config` section of the documentation linked above.
    1. Click **Save**.
