## How to run the docs locally
1. Follow the instructions in https://docs-wiki.cfapps.io/wiki/external/preview-changes.html#preview-bookdocker
1. cd into `docs-book-healthwatch` and edit the `config.yml`
    1. Under the `sections:` comment out the docs branch that you are not currently working on.
       This is needed to have `bookdocker watch` work as expected.
       
       **Note:** Don't commit this file.
1. Run `bookdocker watch` in `docs-book-healthwatch` folder, and you will get local preview under: `http://127.0.0.1:4567/platform/healthwatch/<VERSION>/installing.html`
   If it doesn't work, run it again, and again... and if that doesn't work, ask for help in the #pcf-docs Slack channel.
