Healthwatch ships with the following dashboards
included under the **Healthwatch** folder in Grafana.
To access them, go to **Dashboard -> Manage -> Healthwatch** in Grafana.

## <a id="healthwatch-slos"></a> Healthwatch - SLOs
This dashboard will display a row
for each instance selected from the corresponding instance drop down
at the top of the page.
Each row has four panels:

  * The **Up** panel shows the current health of the [up](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/) metric,
    where a `1` indicates it is healthy
    and a `0` or missing data indicates that it is not healthy.
  * The **Exporter SLO** panel shows the percent of time the exporter was up over the selected time range.
  * The **Error Budget Remaining** panel shows how much time, in minutes, are left,
    in order to stay within the selected Uptime SLO Target
    over the currently selected time range.
  * The **Minutes of Downtime** panel shows how much downtime, in minutes,
    the exporters have experienced during the selected time range.

### <a id='bosh-metrics-exporter'></a> BOSH Metrics Exporter fails to Connect to BOSH

#### Problem

```
ERROR [context.UaaContext [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3]] javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors
ERROR [ingress.TokenCallCredentials [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3]] Caught error retrieving UAA token: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors
INFO  [ingress.EventStreamObserver [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3]] io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAUTHENTICATED
```

#### Cause

BOSH Metrics Exporter cannot verify the cert chain of BOSH Director UAA Server.

#### Troubleshooting

Follow the steps below to confirm the cert chain is invalid.

1. `ssh` into the `pks-exporter` vm which hosts the BOSH metrics exporter job
1. `openssl s_client -connect 10.0.0.5:8443` to obtain the certificate used by UAA,
    and save it to a file (`cert.pem`).
1. `openssl verify cert.pem` should return the literal string "OK",
    meaning the certificate is trusted and has a valid certificate chain.
    Otherwise, if any other message is returned, see
    [OpenSSL diagnostic documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/openssl-verify.html#DIAGNOSTICS)
    to troubleshoot and remedy.
    Certificate errors must be corrected before the BOSH Metrics Exporter will work.


## <a id="healthwatch-exporter-troubleshooting"></a> Healthwatch - Exporter Troubleshooting

This dashboard provides a detailed look at the performance of an individual exporter.
It is helpful to look at these dashboards
when you see spotty graphs for a particular metric type,
or if an exporter is not behaving as it should.
The dashboard consists of the following metrics:

  * Exporter Info: A listing of the `healthwatch_pasExporter_status` metric that contains
    runtime information for the exporter.
  * Exporter JVM Memory: A graph of `jvm_memory_bytes_used`, `jvm_memory_bytes_commited`, and
    `jvm_memory_bytes_init` over the time range,
    in order to check for memory leaks.
  * Ephemeral Disk Usage: A gauge of `system_disk_ephemeral_percent`, in order to check if the
    disk is nearing capacity.
  * Rate of Garbage Collection: A graph of the rate of `jvm_gc_collection_seconds_sum` over
    the time range,
    in order to check if JVM garbage collection is causing issues.
  * Rate of Envelope Ingress: A graph of the rate of `healthwatch_pasExporter_ingress_envelopes`
    over the time range,
    in order to see if there has been a spike in the amount
    of envelopes received by the exporter.
  * CPU Usage: A graph of `cpu_usage_user` over the time range,
    in order the see if the CPU used by the exporter is reaching capacity.
  * Exporter VM Threads: A graph of `jvm_threads_current` and `jvm_threads_peak` over the time range,
    in order to see if the exporter is leaking threads.
