This topic describes how to resolve common issues with Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch.

## <a id='memory-limit'></a>Memory Limit Errors

Insufficient memory allocation can cause issues when you install or upgrade PCF Healthwatch.

### Error

If a PCF environment exceeds the total memory limit set for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org, the PCF Healthwatch `push-apps` errand can fail. When this occurs, the error message looks similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ /var/vcap/packages/cf-cli/bin/cf start cf-health-check
Starting app cf-health-check in org system / space healthwatch as admin...
FAILED
Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100005, message: You have exceeded your organization's memory limit: app requested more memory than available
</pre>

### Cause

Your PCF environment has an insufficient total memory quota set for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org.

The issue should not occur if the Apps Manager errand has run in your environment. Because service tiles use the `system` org to execute smoke tests, the Apps Manager errand sets the default `system` org quota to `runaway`. If the Apps Manager errand has not run or failed, the default `system` quota may not be reset properly.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you can set the default memory quota for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org to at least 24 GB and re-run the `push-apps` errand manually.


## <a id='opsman-health'></a>Ops Manager Health Check Errors

The Opsmanager Health Check needs the ability to reach Ops Manager on the underlying network.

### Error

This error will appear as constantly failing Ops Manager Health Checks on the Dashboard and `Ops Manager Health Check History` page even though Ops Manager is running.

### Cause

The `opsmanager-health-check` application attempts to connect to Ops Manager in order to verify it is running.  This application needs the correct network settings in order to be able to reach the Ops Manager VM.  If there are firewall rules in place that prevent the network access then this check will continually fail.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, please confirm that the `opsmanager-health-check` application is attempting to reach the Ops Manager VM on a URL that is accessible from that instance.  This can be verified by using `cf ssh opsmanager-health-check` to SSH into the running instance.  Then enter `curl -v $OPSMANAGER_URL` to check the network access.  If the certificate will not validate you can set `SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION=true` in the environment variables.

If the network access can not be modified to allow the `opsmanager-health-check` application to reach Ops Manager, then this test cannot be executed properly and should be [disabled](installing.html#healthwatch-opsman).
