## <a id='memory-limit'></a>Memory Limit Errors

Insufficient memory allocation can cause issues when you install or upgrade PCF Healthwatch.

### Error

If a PCF environment exceeds the total memory limit set for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org, the PCF Healthwatch `push-apps` errand can fail. When this occurs, the error message looks similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
$ /var/vcap/packages/cf-cli/bin/cf start cf-health-check
Starting app cf-health-check in org system / space healthwatch as admin...
FAILED
Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100005, message: You have exceeded your organization's memory limit: app requested more memory than available
</pre>

### Cause

Your PCF environment has an insufficient total memory quota set for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org.

The issue should not occur if the Apps Manager errand has run in your environment. Because service tiles use the `system` org to execute smoke tests, the Apps Manager errand sets the default `system` org quota to `runaway`. If the Apps Manager errand has not run or failed, the default `system` quota may not be reset properly.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you can set the default memory quota for the `healthwatch` space in the `system` org to at least 24 GB and re-run the `push-apps` errand manually.
