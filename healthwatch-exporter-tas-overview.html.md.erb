The **Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs** tile deploys metric exporter VMs to generate each
type of metric related to the health of your TAS for VMs deployment.

Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs sends metrics through the Loggregator Firehose to a Prometheus
exposition endpoint on the associated metric exporter VMs. The Prometheus VM that exists within
your metrics monitoring system then scrapes the exposition endpoints on the metric exporter
VMs and imports those metrics into your monitoring system.

Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs exposes the following metrics related to the functionality
of TAS for VMs components, TAS for VMs apps, and the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile:

* SLIs for TAS for VMs components
* Canary URL tests for TAS for VMs apps
* Counter, gauge, and timer app logs for TAS for VMs from the Loggregator Firehose
* Super Value Metrics (SVMs) from Healthwatch v1
* VMs deployed by Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VM
