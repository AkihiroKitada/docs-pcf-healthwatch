## <a id='features'></a>About Pivotal Healthwatch

Pivotal Healthwatch is a service for monitoring and alerting on the current health, performance, and capacity of PCF. To help operators understand the operational state of their PCF deployment, Pivotal Healthwatch:

* Stores, visualizes and alerts on metrics from core PCF components, including BOSH-reported VM metrics. The service covers the recommended [Key Performance Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) for a given version of PCF.
* Executes health checks as continuous validation tests and creates super metrics. The service stores, displays, and forwards this data into the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose) for external consumption by existing customer solutions. For more information, see [Pivotal Healthwatch Metrics](metrics.html) and [Access Super Metrics Through the Firehose](using.html#firehose).

All data points are stored in Pivotal Healthwatch for 25 hours and then pruned. Any active alerts that have been pruned will re-alert every 24 hours if not cleared.
