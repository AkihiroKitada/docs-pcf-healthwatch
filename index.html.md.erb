<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>
The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only.
Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.
</p>

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch stores and visualizes recommended key operational metrics from core PCF components, including bosh-reported VM metrics, to help Operators better understand the current health, performance, and capacity of a given PCF Foundation. PCF Healthwatch also creates measures of operational value via recommended continuous validation tests and contextually derived metrics; forwarding these product-specific measures into the firehose for existing customer solutions to pick up as desired.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

PCF Healthwatch includes the following key features:

* Offers an opinionated PCF Operational Monitoring dashboard, providing coverage of the recommended [Key Performance Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/kpi.html) and [Key Scaling Indications](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html) for a given version of PCF. Associated data is currently retained for 25 hours. 
* Executes recommended operational health checks as continuous validation tests, storing and displaying results, as well as [forwarding](using.html#firehose) result data into the firehose for consumption by existing firehose consumers.

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

* Does not currently ingest BOSH VM metrics outside of the core CF deployment.
* Intended to monitor the foundation it is installed on only.
* This product is still under active deployment. Therefore some links to deep-dive screens may still be inactive. Please see [Known Issues](release-notes.html) for current status.
* Currently, only the Google Chrome browser is supported when accessing the product UI.
* If an earlier version of PCF Healthwatch is installed, it must be deleted before proceeding with the installation of the newer tile. The tile is not upgradable at this time.
* The installation process is complex; we are looking to address this in future versions, but still welcome feedback on this topic.
