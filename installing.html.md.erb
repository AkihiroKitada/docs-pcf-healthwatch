This topic describes how to install and configure Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) Healthwatch.

##<a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before deploying PCF Healthwatch, ensure that you have:

* PCF Ops Manager v1.11.0 or later
* PCF Elastic Runtime v1.11.9 or later

##<a id='install'></a> Install PCF Healthwatch

1. Download the product and supporting files from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-healthwatch).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the main product file. 

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of PCF Healthwatch.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

##<a id='configure'></a> Configure BOSH Director Health Check in PCF Healthwatch 

To start using PCF Healthwatch, you need to add a service network to the Ops Manager Director and PCF Healthwatch tiles. This is the subnet on which PCF Healthwatch runs BOSH health checks.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Creating a service network ensures that Ops Manager will not attempt to use the same IP address as the BOSH Health Check VM.</p>

###<a id='ops-man'></a> Step 1. Configure the Ops Manager Director Tile

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have already completed this step during a prior installation of PCF Healthwatch, it does not need to be repeated.</p>

To configure Ops Manager Director, perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Ops Manager Director** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Create Networks** and click **Add Network**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter `bosh-health-check`.

1. Enter the network details for your Service Network. The Bosh Heathcheck service only requires a single unreserved IP.
1. Click **Save**.  
1. You do not need to click **Apply Changes** yet.  You can install the HealthWatch tile along with the director changes.

##<a id='bosh-metrics'></a> Getting BOSH Health Metrics into PCF Healthwatch

Forwarding BOSH health metrics to PCF Healthwatch currently requires manual configuration. You must have PCF Admin permissions to configure the BOSH Director.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The manual configuration is required for the alpha and beta releases of PCF Healthwatch.</p>

To configure the BOSH Director, follow the instructions below. The referenced plugins are available on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-healthwatch).


1. Copy `healthwatch-bosh-plugin`, `run.sh`, and `healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json` to the BOSH Director.
1. Run `sudo` in the BOSH Director.
1. Create the following directories:

	<pre class="terminal">
	mkdir -p /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/
	mkdir -p /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/
	mkdir -p /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/
	mkdir -p /var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/
	</pre>
1. Move the copied files as follows:
	<pre class="terminal">
	mv /tmp/healthwatch-bosh-plugin /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/
	mv /tmp/run.sh /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/
	mv /tmp/healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/
	</pre>
1. Assign the following permissions:
	<pre class="terminal">
	chown vcap:vcap /var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/
	chmod 755 /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/bin/bosh-monitor/run.sh
	chmod 755 /var/vcap/packages/healthwatch/healthwatch-bosh-plugin
	chmod 644 /var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json
	chmod 750 /var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/
	</pre>
1. Edit and update the `/var/vcap/jobs/healthwatch/config/healthwatch-bosh-plugin.json` file with your MySQL IP and credentials.
1. Verify that the JSON plugin is enabled in `/var/vcap/jobs/health_monitor/config/health_monitor.yml`.
	<pre>
	{"name":"json","events":["alert","heartbeat"],"options":{}}
	</pre>
1. Run `monit restart health_monitor` and verify that logs are created in `/var/vcap/sys/log/healthwatch/`.
