This topic explains a shift in how Healthwatch handles alerting.
This document aims to explain how to configure alerting
in the Healthwatch tile in Ops Manager.

## Alerting

To configure alerting for the Healthwatch tile,
perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Prometheus Configuration**.
1. Input the **Alerting Rules YAML** that represents
    the features of your foundation (explained below).
1. Click **Save**.

## Which alerts will you need?

You will need different alerting rules
based on what tiles you have installed in your foundation.

Regardless of what tiles you have installed,
you'll need the following default config for all foundations,
which includes: Bosh Director health, cert expiration, and Ops Manager health.
