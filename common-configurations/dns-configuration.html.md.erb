This topic both describes the general flow of setting up DNS for your Grafana instance,
and gives a specific example using GCP.

## General flow
* Identify the IP of the Grafana VM created by the Healthwatch 2.0 deployment.
* Create a Type A record pointing to that IP.
* Wait for DNS to update
    (this can be sped up by tweaking your computer's DNS settings).
* Visit the URL you pointed to your Grafana instance
    and ensure that you land on the Grafana login page as expected.

## GCP Example
* After signing into your Cloud Console,
    navigate to **Compute Engine > VM instances**
* Filter by **grafana** to find the Grafana VM
    that was created with your Healthwatch deployment.
* If you only have one foundation, it should be easy to identify the correct vm
    because it will be the only one listed after the filter.
    Otherwise, add a filter to narrow it down to a specific foundation.
    For example, we can find the Grafana instance for our control plan foundation by typing **hw-cp**.
* Copy the IP in the **External IP** field of the results.
* Navigate to **Network services > Cloud DNS**.
* Filter for your foundation's DNS zone.
    Following our control plane example, we should type **hw-cp-zone**.
    Click on the zone name to open the interface for editing the zone.
* Click **Add record set**.
* Input **grafana** into the **DNS Name** field.
    Notice that the rest of the domain is already populated
    because this record is being created within the context of a DNS zone.
* Make sure **Resource Record Type** is set to **A**.
* We recommend setting **TTL** (Time To Live) to **1** and **TTL Unit** to **seconds**
    to reduce the amount of time you'll have to wait to verify the change worked.
* Paste your IP into the **IPv4 Address** field.
* Click **CREATE**.
* Visit `grafana.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`,
    where `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is the same URL you would use to visit your Ops Manager (`pcf.SYSTEM-DOMAIN`).
    In our example, this is `grafana.hw-cp.cf-denver.com`.
* If this does not yet load the Grafana login page as expected,
    you can add Google's DNS Server (`8.8.8.8`) to your computer's network configuration.
    How you go about this will depend on your operating system,
    but you will likely find adequate instructions by searching for
    **Add DNS server MY-OS** in your search engine of choice,
    where `MY-OS` is the operating system of your computer (e.g. OSX, Windows, Ubuntu, etc.).
* Once you see the Grafana login page,
    you have confirmed that you have successfully created a DNS entry!
