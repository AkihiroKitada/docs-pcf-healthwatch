TSDB can be configured to write to remote storage,
in addition to its local time series database.
This is intended to support long-term storage of monitoring data.

For the full configuration for remote writing,
see [&lt;remote_write&gt;](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write)
in the Prometheus configuration documentation.

The form in the **Healthwatch** tile is
basically a user-friendly input
to this more complete configuration.

## Configure Remote Write

To configure remote write for the Healthwatch tile,
perform the following steps:

1. Click the **Healthwatch** tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Navigate to **Remote Write Configuration**.
1. Input the **URL** for your storage endpoint.<br>
    For example, `https://REMOTE-STORAGE-URL`,
    where `REMOTE-STORAGE-URL` is a fully-qualified domain name.
1. (Optional) Set a **Remote Timeout**.
1. (Optional) Enable Basic Authentication
    to access your storage endpoint via username and password.
1. (Optional) Configure TLS for your endpoint.
    If the remote write endpoint requires special handling,
    for example a self-signed cert or mutual TLS,
    that can be configured here.
1. (Optional) Configure a **Proxy URL** to connect to the remote write endpoint.
1. (Optional) Fine-tune your remote write configuration.
   For information, see [&lt;remote_write&gt;](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write)
   in the Prometheus configuration documentation.
1. Click **Save**.
