The **Healthwatch** tile gathers metrics across multiple Ops Manager foundations by scraping
them from Healthwatch Exporter tiles installed on each foundation.

Healthwatch deploys instances of Prometheus and Grafana. The Prometheus instance scrapes and
stores metrics from the Healthwatch Exporter tiles and enables you to configure alerts with
Alertmanager.

Healthwatch then exports the collected metrics to dashboards in Grafana, enabling you to visualize
the data with charts and graphs and create customized dashboards for long-term monitoring and
troubleshooting.

Healthwatch includes the following features:

* **Prometheus:**
  * Scrapes `/metrics` endpoints for Healthwatch Exporter tiles, collecting metrics related
  to the functionality of platform- and runtime-level components that include the following:
      * Service level indicators (SLIs) for the BOSH Director
      * SLIs for TAS for VMs components
      * SLIs for TKGI components
      * When Ops Manager certificates are due to expire
      * Canary URL tests for TAS for VMs apps
      * Counter, gauge, and timer app logs for TAS for VMs from the Loggregator Firehose
      * BOSH system metrics for TKGI
      * VMs deployed by Healthwatch Exporter tiles
  * Stores metrics for up to six weeks
  * Can write to remote storage in addition to its local TSDB

* **Grafana:** Enables you to visualize the collected metrics data in charts and graphs, as
well as create customized dashboards for easier monitoring and troubleshooting

* **Alertmanager:** Manages and sends alerts according to the alerting rules you configure
