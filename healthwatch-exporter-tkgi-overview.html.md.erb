The **Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI** tile deploys metric exporter VMs to generate SLIs related
to the health of your TKGI deployment.

The Prometheus VM that exists within your metrics monitoring system then scrapes the Prometheus
exposition endpoints on the metric exporter VMs and imports those metrics into your monitoring
system.

Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI exposes the following metrics related to the functionality of
TKGI components and the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile:

* SLIs for TKGI components
* BOSH system metrics for TKGI
* VMs deployed by Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI
