        description: |
          Losing the BOSH Director does not significantly impact the experience of Tanzu Application Service end users. However, this issue means a loss of resiliency for BOSH-managed VMs.

          Troubleshooting Steps:
          SSH into the `bosh-health-exporter` VM in the "Healthwatch Exporter" deployment, and view logs to find out why the BOSH Director is failing.

          Issues with Ops Manager health should have no direct end user impacts, however it can can impact an operatorâ€™s ability to perform an upgrade or to rescale the Tanzu Application Service platform when necessary.
